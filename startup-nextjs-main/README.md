# Portfolio Analysis Web Application

This website is built using the Next.js framework and leverages Node.js's built-in WebSocket to establish a connection with the backend server upon user portfolio submission. Once the portfolio is submitted, the server processes the data, performs an analysis, and sends the results back to the client for real-time display.
